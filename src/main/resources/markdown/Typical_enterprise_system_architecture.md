Every scalable enterprise architecture shares a good portion of common types of elements and patterns that are shown in the diagram. Understanding them is important to be able to make good architectural decisions in case of building a new scalable system.

###### {"semantic":"explanation"}

Every system architecture is composed of premade components and parts that are custom made to fit everything is one working environment. Good selection of premade components and their integration becomes extremely important skills. The better premade tools we choose, less custom effort is required which is the most expensive part.
